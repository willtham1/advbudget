This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Welcome!

This is currently a work in progress Advance Budget Application. The goal of this app is to track a users budget as well as future bills. Unlike a traditional budget application this would be a more advance tracker with a dedicated backend that will most likley be hosted on my own homelab or a firebase instance.

Technologies that will be included within this project will be.
```
Front-End
- HTML
- CSS
    - Tailwind
- Javascript
- Typescript
- React
    - Next.js
Back-end
- Golang or C# (Still debating)
Database
